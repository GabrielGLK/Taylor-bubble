# Taylor-bubble 
In this repository, we mainly introduce the test cases of an individual Taylor bubble rises through different pipes in stagnant liquid.
## Description of physical problem
Taylor bubble (slug bubble) is an essential part of two-phase flow, which can be widely used in nuclear plants, [volcanology](https://github.com/GabrielGLK/Taylor-bubble/blob/main/figure/taylor-application-1.pdf), [biomedical engineering](https://github.com/GabrielGLK/Taylor-bubble/blob/main/figure/taylor-application-2.pdf). 
This is an interesting [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTFylkr018U&ab_channel=FluidDynamics) for air Taylor bubble in water. The [schematic diagram](https://github.com/GabrielGLK/Taylor-bubble/blob/main/figure/taylor-schematic.pdf) of Taylor bubble shows Taylor bubble is composed of nose, body, tail, liquid film and so on.
# [Straight pipes](https://github.com/GabrielGLK/Taylor-bubble/tree/main/straight-pipe)
- [Readme](https://github.com/GabrielGLK/Taylor-bubble/blob/main/straight-pipe/Readme.md): in this section, we did grid independency analysis, sensitivity analysis. In addition, we compare Basilisk simulations with reference data and also compare the experimental results of Chengsi with the present simulations.
# [Sudden pipes](https://github.com/GabrielGLK/Taylor-bubble/tree/main/sudden)
- [Readme](https://github.com/GabrielGLK/Taylor-bubble/blob/main/sudden/Readme.md):In experiments, five different expansion ratios are performed, which are 1.73,1.45,1.35,1.24,1.12. The lower pipe diameter is 16.20mm.
