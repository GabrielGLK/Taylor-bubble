# Taylor-bubble 
In this repository, we mainly introduce the test cases of an individual Taylor bubble rises through different pipes in stagnant liquid.
## Description of physical problem
Taylor bubble (slug bubble) is an essential part of two-phase flow, which can be widely used in nuclear plants, [volcanology](https://github.com/GabrielGLK/Taylor-bubble/blob/main/figure/taylor-application-1.pdf), [biomedical engineering](https://github.com/GabrielGLK/Taylor-bubble/blob/main/figure/taylor-application-2.pdf). 
This is an interesting [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTFylkr018U&ab_channel=FluidDynamics) for air Taylor bubble in water. The [schematic diagram](https://github.com/GabrielGLK/Taylor-bubble/blob/main/figure/taylor-schematic.pdf) of Taylor bubble shows Taylor bubble is composed of nose, body, tail, liquid film and so on.
